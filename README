OVERVIEW

The glFusion Usage Stats [GUS] plugin collects statistics on who visits your
site, what browser and operating system they are using, which pages they view,
and which links they are clicking to get there. It allows the administrator
to browse these stats through a series of tables, getting right down into the
data.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

GUS has the following system requirements:

    * PHP 4.3.3 and higher. Because of some security issues PHP 4.3.10 or
      higher is strictly recommended. (PHP5 should be fine.)
    * glFusion v1.2.2 or newer

INSTALLATION

The GUS Plugin uses the glFusion automated plugin installer.
Simply upload the distribtuion using the glFusion plugin installer located in
the Plugin Administration page.

UPGRADING

The upgrade process is identical to the installation process, simply upload
the distribution from the Plugin Administration page.

CONFIGURATION

In the Admin block you will find a link to the GUS admin page where you may
set up ignored IP addresses, pages, and users. By default the user and IP of
the user who installed the plugin is entered in the ignore list and statistics
capture is turned on. The admin page lets you enter additional users and IPs
for which usage information will not be collected. It also allows you to enable
and disable statics capture.

Set up security. Upon install, only the root users have access to statistics
admin and viewing. You can delegate control for either of these functions
through the user and group editors.

Review the privacy policy. The installation also provides a privacy policy
page. This is controlled by the $_GUS_priv variable in the config.php file.
If your site already has a privacy policy available to your site users, I
would encourage you to review it and see that it is worded so that your site
users know what information is being collected about them. If you allowed
anonymous access, a link to the visitor statistics viewer is also added.

There are several variables in the config.php file which control the display
of information. These are documented in the file itself.
